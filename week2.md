# Week 2 – Creating Communication Templates

**Date:** 2026-02-17  

**What I learned:**  
- How to create professional templates for warnings, mutes, and bans  
- How to phrase messages clearly and empathetically  
- How to maintain consistency in tone and documentation  

**Reflection:**  
This week showed me that clear communication is as important as rule enforcement.
Templates save time and make moderation more consistent and professional.
