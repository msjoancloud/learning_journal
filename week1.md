# Week 1 – Learning Moderation Logging

**Date:** 2026-02-10  

**What I learned:**  
- How to log moderation incidents professionally using Markdown  
- How to create clean, organized tables for tracking user actions

**Reflection:**  
This week helped me understand that moderation is not just about enforcing rules,
but also about keeping detailed records to ensure fairness and accountability.
